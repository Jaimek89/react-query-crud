# React Query CRUD

## About What

>In this CRUD we are managing products in order to put in practice how React Query works. We have used useQuery and useMutation and it's funcionalities like queryKey, queryFn, select, mutationFn, onSuccess, onError, isLoading, isError, error, mutate and invalidateQueries. We have also tried how json server works in order to fake backend responses.
